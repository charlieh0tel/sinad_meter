# TODO

- Reorganize ee_stuff.  Pull the isntrument support out as its own
  repo.  Make this use that as a submodule.  This is currently a mess.
  
- Change auto_sinad.py to support either the soft meter or the
  Keithley or both but not always both.  The comparisons are over.

- Make the siggen configurable from the command line.
