# Software SINAD meter

This is a software SINAD meter.  It display both the audio waveform
and the SINAD for the current acquisition window and a filtered SINAD
value as text.

For acquisition the code supports:
- bog standard audio capture devices via PortAudio
- Digilent devices supproted via pydwf (but only AD3 is known to work)

It has only been tested on Linux.  (It might work on Windoze; it might not.)
